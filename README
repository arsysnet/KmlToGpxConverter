This is a tool for converting kml files from the MyTracks android app
to Lightroom compatible gpx files.

Usage:
* Drag'n'drop files to convert on to the window


NOTE: This tool strips away all information not related to pure position
data used by Lightroom, so it is not a general purpose kml to gpx converter.
